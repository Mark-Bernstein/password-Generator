# password-Generator
Program to generate a random secure password 

Motivation

This is a password generator that I built for a project in the UCSD web development bootcamp program. The goal of the password generator is to give a user the option to choose which characters they would like to include in their password, such as numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or special characters, as well as the length of the password (8-128 characters long). The user can then copy the newly generated password to their clipboard. 

Code style

The application uses standard HTML markup style and the program is written in JavaScript. 

Installation

No installation necessary. Project is hosted here: https://mark-bernstein.github.io/password-Generator/
